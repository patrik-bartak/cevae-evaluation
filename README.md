# Evaluation of Causal Machine Learning Methods
This repository is part of the Bachelor's thesis project of Patrik Bartak for CSE3000 in Q4 2022. It is based on the repository of Matej Havelka.
To access the bachelors thesis you might require TU Delft login, the paper can be found in the TU Delft repository [TODO: provide link]().

# How to run it
To add run the experiment you can run the [main script](sample/main.py). It might take quite a while (at least 2 hours on my setup).
Afterwards you should be able to find the results in newly generated directories, most importantly in the parameterization directory.

# How to extend it
To add a new model you need to extend the CausalMethod class in [the appropriate class](sample/causal_effect_methods.py). Then add a new function to the [experiment builder](sample/experiment.py) that adds the causal method.
Afterwards you can construct the experiment with whatever data generators there are.

To add a new generator you need to create a new function in [experiment builder](sample/experiment.py) where you define the necessary functions to generate that data. With that you can add it to any experiment as you would with other generators.
